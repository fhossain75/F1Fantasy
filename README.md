# 🏎️ F1Fantasy
A data-driven project to explore Formula 1 trends, analyze performance, and build predictive models aimed at optimizing F1 Fantasy team selection — all in pursuit of my first fantasy league win.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project began as a simple exercise to learn dynamic programming and solve a knapsack-style problem: 
picking the best possible F1 Fantasy team under budget. It quickly grew into a tool to benchmark my weekly picks 
against the optimal selection.  

Next, I plan to integrate machine learning to predict top-performing teams using performance trends and track data.

## ⚙️ Usage

### 1. Prepare the Data
Ensure your datasets are organized within a root directory. For example, place your files under `./data`.

### 2. Run the Analysis Pipeline
Run the main script with the root directory as an argument:

```bash
python main.py ./data
```
